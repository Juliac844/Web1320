            <p> I loved anime since I was a child. My first ever anime I saw was Sailor Moon and i was enchanted by how colorful and magical it was. I remember forcing my mom to wake up in the middle of the night just to press the play button on my hanging tv to rewatch the same episode over and over again on my VCR. Ever since then, I have broaden my library of all different genres of anime. I genuinely believe when I'm old, I'll still be a fan.</p>
